                    <p>
                        I am currently at school,before which i was farming to raise money.
                    </p>
                    <p> In my younger and more vulnerable years
                        my father gave me some advice that I've
                        been turning over in my mind ever since.
                        'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me,
                        'just remember that all the people in this world
                        haven't had the advantages that you've had'and thats where my inspirations come from,I aspire to
                        always
                        help the less advantaged people around me.
                    </p>
                    <p> I aspire to have the leading Tech company in the world,and to be a part of it.
                        My dream is to work with AI technology that can make people's lives easier.
                        I want to use my skills to create something that will benefit humanity.
                        And I hope to become an entrepreneur who creates products or services that solve real problems
